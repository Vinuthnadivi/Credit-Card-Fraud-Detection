## 🧠 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a serious issue in today's digital financial landscape. This project demonstrates the use of a **machine learning model** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. We use **Logistic Regression** for classification after balancing the dataset to ensure effective training.

The goal is to:
- Reduce false negatives (missed fraud cases)
- Maintain high precision and recall
- Provide an explainable and efficient solution
